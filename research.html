        <h2>
          Current Research
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am currently undertaking a project on 'Understanding and quantifying the inter-sex diferences of irinotecan in mice.',
          alongside the Chronotherapy group at Warwick Medical School and .
          This will be directly linked with clinical research and will help improve cancer treatment protocol in colorectal cancer.
          I will be improving current models on circadian pharmcokinetics of irinotecan, with specific focus on sex, as well as looking at which of the known circadian influences on the pharmacodynamics of irinotecan are most important.

          The impact of chronotherapy can be read about in a recent article in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/circadian-rhythms-influence-treatment-effects-31746" target="_blank">The Scientist</a>.

          Previous Research
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first part of my PhD focussed on "Optimizing circadian drug infusion schedules towards personalized cancer chronotherapy". This project involved developing multiple mathematical models which made it possible to predict precise drug delivery, as well as quantifying inter-patient variability by assessing pharmacokinetic parameters.

          An MSc Group Research Project inolved using a new package in Python to solve convex optimisations questions in wireless communication systems.
          This project has now been published in <a target="_blank" href="https://ima.org.uk/10109/communicating-with-convexity/">Mathematics today</a>. As a result of this project my group and I have had our example codes published on the official repository of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/applications/optimal_power_gaussian_channel_BV4.62.html">CVXPY website</a> and the  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/tree/master/examples">CVXPY github pages</a>. This project not only gave me the oportunity to expand my skills into other areas of research but pushed me to become proficient in Python.

          My MSc at the University of Nottingham involved developing models to further the understanding of multi-antimicrobial resistance on single plasmids in bacteria. This allowed me to build skills in mathematical modelling as well as further my skills in coding within Matlab.
