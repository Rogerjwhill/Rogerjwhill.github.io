        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a currently in the third year of my PhD with in the Mathsys CDT at the University of Warwick. I will be finishing my PhD in October 2019.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Current Research
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am currently undertaking a project on 'Understanding and quantifying the inter-sex diferences of irinotecan in mice.',
          alongside the Chronotherapy group at Warwick Medical School and .
          This will be directly linked with clinical research and will help improve cancer treatment protocol in colorectal cancer.
          I will be improving current models on circadian pharmcokinetics of irinotecan, with specific focus on sex, as well as looking at which of the known circadian influences on the pharmacodynamics of irinotecan are most important.

          The impact of chronotherapy can be read about in a recent article in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/circadian-rhythms-influence-treatment-effects-31746">The Scientist</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Previous Research
        </h2>
        <p>
          This first part of my PhD focussed on "Optimizing circadian drug infusion schedules towards personalized cancer chronotherapy". This project involved development multiple mathematical models which made it possible to predict precise drug delivery, as well as quantifying inter-patient variability by assessing pharmacokinetic parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my MSc at the University of Nottingham I worked on understanding the development of multi-antimicrobial resistance on single plasmids in bacteria. This allowed me to build skills in developing mathematical models from fundamental biological reactions as well as further my skills in coding within Matlab. I am looking at continuing research in mathematical biology throughout my time at Mathsys.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Group Research Project in the autumn of the MSc year, my group and I undertook a project to use a new package in Python to solve convex optimisations questions in wireless communication systems.
          This project has now been published in Mathematics today, and can the PDF can be downloaded here. As a result of this project my group and I have had our example codes published on the official repository of the <a href="http://www.cvxpy.org/en/latest/examples/index.html">CVXPY website</a> and the  <a href="https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/tree/master/examples">CVXPY github pages</a>. This project not only gave me the oportunity to expand my skills into other areas of research but pushed me to become proficient in Python.
