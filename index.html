        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently in the third year of my PhD with in the <a target="_blank" href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/">Mathematics for Real-World Systems Centre for Doctoral Training</a> at the University of Warwick. I will be finishing my PhD in October 2019.
        </p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          I want a career where I can use my extensive skills in computer coding, problem solving and teamwork to help people.
        </P>
        <p>
          I have always had a passion for mathematics and after completing my BSc in mathematics I realised that
          I wanted to help people using the mathematical skills I had developed.
          I initially looked into teaching but realised the level of mathematics was not high enough at secondary school.
          To this end I have started to develop skills in mathematical modelling,
          in particular a MSc in mathematical medicine and biology at Nottingham University.
          This gave me a good view of many different modelling techniques and introduced me to
          coding in both Matlab and Pyton.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there I joined the Mathematics of Real World Systems Centre for
          Doctoral Training at the University of Warwick.
          In the masters year I was introduced to many new topics and techniques in a wide range of modelling areas from biology to finance.
          I also met my supervisor who introduced me to my current field of research, mathematical pharmacology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research I am focusing on is mathematical chrono-pharmacology,
          which is timing drug delivery to the optimum time of day for an individual patient.
          This has lead me to a much deeper understanding of the rhythms of the body and the
          mathematical techniques that can be used to solve these problems and give clinicians
          a greater understanding of the way drugs interact with our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My education has lead me to develop many skills and also the ability to adapt and learn new skills.
          I have recently begun to build web development skills. I have developed this website and <a target="_blank" title="Still under development.">Louth Methodist Church</a> website, as well as a simple <a target="_blank" href="game.html">web game</a>.
        </p>


        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been an avid sportsman. Since a very early age I have played hockey for local and school teams.
          I was also the youth representative on my local club's committee, these experiences helped me develop
          teamwork skills and an understand how organisation work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At university I continued my passion for hockey and captained the mens 1st team.
          This helped develop my leadership skills and gave me a deeper understanding of how it is to steer people towards a common goal.
          In my final year at Keele University I began to learn Salsa.
          Dancing was something I had always wanted to do but it took until my final year to have the courage to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dancing has helped my confidence, and the challenge of dancing with strangers and preforming has helped me with my presentation skills. I have been able to work on how to portray information and engage with
          an audience by learning to control my nerves, and understanding what people want from presentations.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Development</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my PhD at the Universty of Warwick I have undertaken different courses in transferable skills. These have helped me work on different aspects of my personal development from communication to teamwork and leadership. The science communication module helped me addvance my communication skills by looking at portraying the same information to different audiences
          and how this is important in academia but perhaps more important in industry. The courses in team work and, decision making and leadership helped me to focus on my interpersonal skills, working on understanding others and how best to interact with colleagues. These courses have let me expand on my skill set and improve my overall value to a workforce.
