        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>I have always had a passion for mathematics and after completing my BSc in mathematics I realised that I wanted to help people using mathematics skills I had developed. I initially looked into teaching but realised the level of mathematics was not high enough at secondary school.
          To this end I have started to develop skills in mathematical modelling, inparticular a MSc in mathematical medicine and biology at Nottingham University. This gave me a good view of many different modelling techniques and introduced me to mathematical and computation coding in both Matlab and Pyton.
          From there I joined the Mathematics of real world systems centre for doctoral training at the University of Warwick. In the masters year I was introduced to many new topics and techniques. I also met my current supervisor who introduced me to my current field of research, mathematical pharmacology.
          The current project which I am focusing on is mathematical chrono-pharmacology, which is timing drug delivery to the optimum time of day for the patient. This has lead me to a much deeper understanding of the rhythms of the body and the mathematical techniques that can be used to solve these problems and give clinicians more detail in understanding the way drugs interact with our bodies.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been an avid sportsmen. Since a very early age I have played hockey for local and school teams. I was also the youth representative on my local team's committee, these experiences helpped me develop
          teamwork skills and a understand how organiseastions work.
          At university I continued my passion for hockey and captianed the mens 1st team for a season. This helped develop my leadership skills and gave my a deeper understanding of how it is to steer people towards a goal.
          In my final year at Keele University I began to learn Salsa. Dancing was something I had always wanted todo but it took until my final year to have the courage to begin. Dancing has given me a new confidence,
          this has helpped me with confidence. The challenge of dancing with strangers and preforming has helpped me with my presentation skills. I have been able to work on how to portray information and engage with
          an audience by controlling my nerves understanding what people want from presentations.
