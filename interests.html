        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          I want a career where I can use my extensive skills in coding, problem solving and teamwork to help people.
        </P>
        <p>
          I have always had a passion for mathematics and after completing my BSc in mathematics I realised that
          I wanted to help people using mathematical skills I had developed.
          I initially looked into teaching but realised the level of mathematics was not high enough at secondary school.
          To this end I have started to develop skills in mathematical modelling,
          in particular a MSc in mathematical medicine and biology at Nottingham University.
          This gave me a good view of many different modelling techniques and introduced me to
          coding in both Matlab and Pyton.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there I joined the Mathematics of Real World Systems Centre for
          Doctoral Training (<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/">MathSys</a>) at the University of Warwick.
          In the masters year I was introduced to many new topics and techniques.
          I also met my current supervisor who introduced me to my current field of research, mathematical pharmacology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current project which I am focusing on is mathematical chrono-pharmacology,
          which is timing drug delivery to the optimum time of day for the patient.
          This has lead me to a much deeper understanding of the rhythms of the body and the
          mathematical techniques that can be used to solve these problems and give clinicians
          more detail in understanding the way drugs interact with our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My education has lead me to develop many skills and also the ability to adapt my abilities to new skills.
          I have recently begun to develop web development skills. I have developed this website and <a>Louth Methodist Church</a> website, as well as a simple <a href="game.html">web game</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been an avid sportsmen. Since a very early age I have played hockey for local and school teams.
          I was also the youth representative on my local club's committee, these experiences helped me develop
          teamwork skills and a understand how organisation work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At university I continued my passion for hockey and captianed the mens 1st team.
          This helped develop my leadership skills and gave my a deeper understanding of how it is to steer people towards a goal.
          In my final year at Keele University I began to learn Salsa.
          Dancing was something I had always wanted todo but it took until my final year to have the courage to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dancing has given me a new confidence,
          this has helpped me with confidence. The challenge of dancing with strangers and preforming has helpped me with my presentation skills. I have been able to work on how to portray information and engage with
          an audience by controlling my nerves understanding what people want from presentations.
